# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building even if conflicts are found.
